All task-related components must include:
- a clear visual for type (timed ⏱️, flexible 🌀)
- tappable status button (Start / Pause / Resume)
- progress feedback (like time left or duration)

Preferred design language:
- Visual hierarchy like Notion
- Interaction clarity like Linear
- Animation rhythm like Things 3

Mobile-first: the app will primarily be used on phones with future support for iOS widgets. Prioritize tap targets, scroll clarity, and readability.

All AI-generated schedules should visually distinguish type and duration.
